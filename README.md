# Hello, I'm Louis! 👋

As a front-end software engineer specializing in React, I enjoy helping companies solve business challenges and optimize results.

## 🛠️ My Skills

- Back End Basics: NodeJS, Express
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library
- Tools: Git, GitHub, npm
- Other: Agile methodologies, CI/CD

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

My recent project is [ToDo+](https://viewsdevelop.github.io/to-do-plus/), a simple yet efficient to-do list application built with React. In this project, I've incorporated features for users to add, delete, and edit their to-do items seamlessly. 

The application is designed with a user-friendly interface and includes a search feature to enhance the user experience, allowing for easy tracking of specific items in the to-do list. 

Moreover, I've ensured that the application is fully responsive to cater to the diverse screen sizes of desktops and mobile devices, thereby reaching a wider audience and providing them with a reliable productivity tool irrespective of their device preference.

Through ToDo+, I've honed my skills in React, explored new libraries and tools, and deepened my understanding of responsive design principles.
