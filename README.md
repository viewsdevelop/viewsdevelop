# Hello, I'm Louis! üëã

**Senior Software Engineer** with over 10 years of experience designing and scaling intelligent, cloud-native systems across AI, SaaS, and enterprise platforms. I‚Äôm fluent in Python (FastAPI, LangChain, TensorFlow) and JavaScript frameworks (Node.js, React, Next.js, Angular, Vue), with strong grounding in PHP and Ruby ecosystems like Laravel, Magento, and Rails. I specialize in building high-availability, service-oriented systems that blend machine learning pipelines, modular microservices, and multi-cloud infrastructure. My focus is on creating architectures that are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with business goals. Having led both new product builds and complex legacy migrations, I bring a practical, systems-level perspective to every project, balancing innovation with reliability. I thrive at the intersection of technology and strategy, helping teams deliver software that‚Äôs both intelligent and built to last.
