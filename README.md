My recent project is [ToDo+](https://viewsdevelop.github.io/to-do-plus/), a user-friendly task management application built with React, Material UI, and Firebase. This application leverages the power of Firestore to enable CRUD persistence across sessions. Additionally, ToDo+ features a live search bar that enables real-time filtering, making it even more convenient for users to find and manage their tasks.
